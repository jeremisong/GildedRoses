This is one of the solutions for refactoring assignment from https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

Things that have been refactored:
    1. Extracted method with logical and meaningful name
    2. Extracted constants
    3. Inversed if-else logic for simplier comprehension
    4. Changed updateQuality from if-else to switch for more structural conditional statements
    5. Use simpler operator. E.g. quality++ isntead of quality = quality +1
    6. Test cases have been covered >90% before changes were made.
